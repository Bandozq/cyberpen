## 4. Features and Functionality

### 4.1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP will focus on the core functionality of the application, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Users can sign up for a new account using their email and password.
    *   Users can log in to their existing account.
    *   Users can log out of their account.
*   **AI-Powered Learning Path Generator:**
    *   Users can input a penetration testing topic (e.g., "SQL Injection," "Active Directory Enumeration").
    *   The application will send a request to the Gemini AI API to generate a detailed learning module for the specified topic.
    *   The generated module will be displayed to the user in a clean, readable format.
*   **Save Learning Paths:**
    *   Authenticated users can save their generated learning paths to their account.
    *   Saved learning paths will be stored in the Supabase database.

### 4.2. Post-MVP Enhancements (Future Scope)

*   **AI Mentor:** An interactive chat interface where users can ask the AI mentor questions about penetration testing.
*   **Study Log:** A dedicated section to view and manage saved learning paths and mentor conversations.
*   **Interactive Checklists:** The ability to track progress through a learning path with interactive checklists.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Visualizations and statistics to show the user's progress over time.
*   **Export Functionality:** The ability to export learning paths to HTML or PDF for offline viewing.
*   **Advanced User Profiles:** User profiles with statistics, achievements, and personalized recommendations.

## 5. User Stories (MVP)

*   **As a new user, I want to sign up for an account** so that I can save my learning progress.
*   **As a returning user, I want to log in to my account** so that I can access my saved learning paths.
*   **As a logged-in user, I want to generate a learning path for a specific topic** so that I can get a structured plan for my studies.
*   **As a logged-in user, I want to save a generated learning path** so that I can refer back to it later.

## 6. Technical Specifications

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** React (using Vite for a fast and modern development environment).
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling.
    *   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` for client-side routing.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Service:** Supabase for the database, authentication, and storage.
*   **AI Integration:**
    *   **Service:** Google Gemini API.

## 7. Assumptions

*   Users will have a modern web browser.
*   Users will be able to obtain their own API keys for Supabase and the Gemini API.
